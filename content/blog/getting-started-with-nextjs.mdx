# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js has revolutionized the way we build React applications, and with version 14, it's become even more powerful. In this post, I'll walk you through the key features and how to get started with your first Next.js project.

## What's New in Next.js 14

The latest version brings several exciting features:

- **App Router**: A new routing system that's more intuitive and powerful
- **Server Components**: Components that render on the server for better performance
- **Turbopack**: A faster bundler for development
- **Improved TypeScript support**: Better type safety and developer experience

## Setting Up Your First Project

Creating a new Next.js project is straightforward:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will create a new project with all the necessary dependencies and start the development server.

## Understanding the App Router

The app router is one of the most significant changes in Next.js 13+. Instead of using a `pages` directory, you now use an `app` directory with a more file-system-based routing approach.

```
app/
├── layout.tsx
├── page.tsx
├── about/
│   └── page.tsx
└── blog/
    ├── page.tsx
    └── [slug]/
        └── page.tsx
```

## Server vs Client Components

One of the key concepts in Next.js 14 is the distinction between server and client components:

- **Server Components**: Render on the server, can access databases directly, and are great for static content
- **Client Components**: Render in the browser, can use React hooks and browser APIs

By default, all components are server components. To make a component a client component, add the `'use client'` directive at the top of the file.

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when building with Next.js 14:

1. **Use Server Components by default**: Only use client components when you need interactivity
2. **Optimize images**: Use the `next/image` component for better performance
3. **Implement proper SEO**: Use the metadata API for better search engine optimization
4. **Handle loading states**: Use loading.tsx files for better user experience

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 is a powerful framework that makes building modern web applications easier and more efficient. With its app router, server components, and improved developer experience, it's an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

The key is to start simple and gradually incorporate more advanced features as you become more comfortable with the framework.
